            In recent years, permanent makeup has become one of the most
            sought-after beauty treatments worldwide, offering a practical and
            elegant solution for people who want to look polished at all times.
            In the heart of Croatia’s capital, PMU Zagreb has established itself
            as a trusted destination for high-quality Trajna šminka services.
            Known for professionalism, personalized care, and refined results,
            PMU Zagreb combines artistic skill with advanced techniques to
            enhance each client’s natural beauty.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What Is PMU Zagreb?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            PMU Zagreb is a specialized cosmetic salon in Zagreb focused
            exclusively on permanent makeup, also known as Trajna šminka. The
            treatments are performed by Jasminka Ćurić, an experienced permanent
            makeup artist with many years of expertise in skin care and PMU
            procedures. Her deep understanding of facial anatomy, pigments, and
            skin behavior allows her to deliver results that are both
            aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            The salon is built on the philosophy that permanent makeup should
            never look artificial or exaggerated. Instead, PMU Zagreb emphasizes
            subtle enhancement, balance, and harmony with each client’s facial
            features. This approach has earned the salon a strong reputation
            among clients seeking elegance, precision, and reliability.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
            Understanding Trajna šminka
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            <a class="text-red-500" href="https://pmu-zagreb.com/"
              >Trajna šminka</a
            >
            is a cosmetic technique in which specially formulated pigments are
            gently implanted into the upper layers of the skin to create the
            appearance of makeup. Unlike traditional cosmetics, permanent makeup
            does not smudge, fade during the day, or require daily application.
            Depending on the area treated, skin type, and lifestyle, results can
            last from one to several years, with occasional touch-ups
            recommended.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            Trajna šminka is particularly popular among people with busy
            lifestyles, athletes, individuals with sensitive skin or allergies
            to conventional makeup, and anyone who wants to save time while
            maintaining a well-groomed appearance. Beyond convenience, it can
            also help correct asymmetry, enhance facial features, and restore
            confidence.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
            Individual Planning and Free Consultations
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            One of the key elements that sets PMU Zagreb apart is its commitment
            to individual planning. Every client begins with a free
            consultation, during which expectations, preferences, and facial
            characteristics are carefully discussed. Jasminka Ćurić takes the
            time to analyze face shape, skin tone, and natural features before
            suggesting the most suitable Trajna šminka technique.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            This personalized approach ensures that no two treatments are the
            same. Instead of following trends blindly, PMU Zagreb focuses on
            creating results that complement the client’s unique appearance and
            personal style. Clients are fully informed about the procedure,
            healing process, and aftercare, which builds trust and confidence
            before any treatment begins.
          </p>

            Popular Trajna šminka Treatments at PMU Zagreb
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            PMU Zagreb offers a range of permanent makeup services, with the
            most popular treatments including eyebrows, lips, and eyes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            <strong>Permanent Eyebrows</strong><br />
            Trajna šminka for eyebrows is one of the most requested services.
            Techniques such as powder brows, hairstroke methods, or combination
            styles are used to create natural-looking, symmetrical brows. This
            treatment is ideal for clients with sparse, uneven, or over-plucked
            eyebrows and provides a polished look without daily filling or
            shaping.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            <strong>Permanent Lip Makeup</strong><br />
            Lip pigmentation enhances the natural color and shape of the lips.
            Trajna šminka for lips can correct asymmetry, define the lip
            contour, and give the appearance of fuller, healthier lips. The
            result is a fresh and youthful look without the need for lipstick.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            <strong>Permanent Eye Makeup</strong><br />
            Eyeliner and lash line enhancement subtly define the eyes, making
            lashes appear fuller and the eyes more expressive. This Trajna
            šminka option is perfect for those who want to avoid daily eyeliner
            application while still enjoying a refined, awake appearance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            All treatments at PMU Zagreb are performed using high-quality
            pigments and modern equipment, following strict hygiene and safety
            standards.

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 tracking-wide">
            The success of permanent makeup largely depends on the skill and
